### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About me:

I am an R&D Engineer and Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for knowledge and creativity. I love collaborating on teams and tackling any kind of challenge whether it's learning something completely new or taking a deeper dive with my current skills. 

When I'm not coding, I spend my free time creating fitness programs, weightlifting, hiking, skiing, and traveling the world as much as I can :earth_americas:

My Front End skills include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, RESTful APIs, REACT, responsive design, PWAs, and a variety of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, Materialize CSS, and MUI.

My Back End skills include: Node.js, OOP, Express.js, user authentication, SQL, Sequelize ORM, MVC paradigm, NoSQL, Apollo-GraphQL, MongoDB, and Mongoose ODM.
